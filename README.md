# Okta Identity Cloud Add-on for Splunk

Using Okta Identity Cloud REST APIs the Okta Identity Cloud Add-on for splunk allows a SplunkÂ® administrator to collect data from the Okta Identity Cloud.
The Add-on collects data related to:

- System log information
- User information
- Group and Group Membership Information
- Application and Application Assignment information

In addition to reading data from the Okta Identity Cloud this Add-on supports adaptive response actions and custom alerts that enable taking the following actions from Splunk:

- Adding and removing Okta users from groups in Okta
- Performing account lifecycle actions (e.g. suspend, deactivate, expire) on Users in Okta

This Add-on provides inputs and CIM-compatible knowledge to use with other Splunk apps, such as Splunk Enterprise Security and the Splunk App for PCI Compliance.
